# Metronome InfoBox

A minimal plugin that displays a visual metronome in an infobox.

The infobox has a count that goes up on every game tick. It counts up to the number of ticks specified in the config before it repeats.

This is useful for activities that require counting ticks.

# Examples

### 4t3g

Click on Celastrus Bark on tick 4 then click on rock on tick 1
